# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals

This project is focused on predicting credit card approvals using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the required packages using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn

Usage
To run the project, run the following command:

python predict_credit_card_approvals.py
The script will train and evaluate the machine learning models and output the results.

Results
The results of the machine learning models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The best performing model is selected based on the evaluation metrics.

Conclusion
In this project, we have explored how to predict credit card approvals using machine learning techniques. We have trained and evaluated multiple models and selected the best performing model based on the evaluation metrics. This project can be used as a starting point for further research on credit card approval prediction.
